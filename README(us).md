- It is crucial to keep the 2FA safe.
- To ensure proper and effective use of the program, it is fundamental to disconnect headphones before activating its functions.
- For optimal operation of the program, stop all media playback before activating its functions.
- All passwords will be encrypted and protected with robust security measures against unauthorized access attempts.

## FUNCTIONALITY

> **This is a step by step order of how CyberBlock works.**
- When you start the program, a QR code will be automatically generated
- It will be necessary to enter the code that the QR provides
- Create a 4 to 6 digit numeric password
- After this process, the program will run in the background
- Activate it with a specific key combination
- A window will appear to enter the set password
- This window will limit access to other system functions
- You will have a maximum of three attempts to enter the password
- Entering the password correctly will reset the system and close the window
- If all three attempts are failed, the program will activate an alarm and capture a photo
- There will be a 30 second countdown before restarting the process
- If you forget your password, use a secondary code
- This step will require the QR code to reset the password
- If you decide to stop the program, use a different key combination
- A similar window will open for the definitive closure of the program
- This window, upon entering the password correctly, will end the program
- It is not recommended to keep active
- This window is exclusively for closing the program, not for security functions
